## 🔧 How It Works

### Import Process
```
1. Fetch total count from AutoScout24
2. Calculate pages (50 listings per page)
3. For each page:
   - Fetch essential data using optimized query
   - Check for existing listing (duplicate prevention)
   - Create new or update existing
   - Import images
   - Add Motors taxonomies and meta
4. Log all operations
```

### Sync Process (Smart Algorithm)
```
1. Fetch ALL remote listing IDs + timestamps (lightweight, ~5KB for 200 listings)
2. Fetch ALL local listing IDs + timestamps from database
3. Compare in memory:
   - Identify NEW listings (in remote, not in local)
   - Identify CHANGED listings (timestamps differ)
   - Identify ORPHANED listings (in local, not in remote)
   - Count UNCHANGED listings
4. Fetch full data ONLY for new/changed listings
5. Auto-trash orphaned listings
6. Log complete summary
```

### Daily Cleanup (3 AM)
```
Priority 1: Duplicate Cleanup
  - Find all duplicate autoscout24-id values
  - Keep oldest listing
  - Merge images to kept listing
  - Delete duplicates
  
Priority 2: Orphan Detection
  - Verify local listings against API
  - Trash any not found in API
  
Priority 3: Trash Cleanup
  - Find listings in trash >30 days
  - Permanently delete with attachments
```
